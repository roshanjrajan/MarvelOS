3.1 
EOI sent for Slave - 10/15
	- Needed to make sure to add EOI for the master before sending to slave
	
Initializing Paging - 10/16
	- Incorrect value for bit shift for the kernel page table
	- Incorrect memory address value inputted into CR0 to enable paging
	- Also needed to make sure the clear the TLB in the beginning to ensure no 
	invalid memory reads
	
Correct Gates for IDT - 10/16
	- Update correct choice for either trap gates or interrrupt gates for each of the
	entries in the idt (exceptions, interrupts, and system call)
	
3.2 
Invalid File Reads - 10/20
	- Offset into file initilized incorrectly - updated to find correct data block
	  and offset into data block

Unable to open the very large text file - 10/21
	- Invalid filename trying to be read from dentries in boot block. Update check 
	to ensure that correct 32 characters are compared with dentry file names.

Update implementation of clear for terminal buffer - 10/21
	- Was not correctly clearning the buffer and needed to store current contents 
	of buffer and output back to the screen when cleared
		
3.3 
Invalid IRET context - 11/7
	- Needed to update the interrupt flag correctly after running cli in setting
	up the iret context (used a bit mask to enable interrupts)

Changing EBP value - 11/11
	- Changing the ebp register resulted in an incorrect read of the return value
	stored on the stack. Needed to update the return value and eax register before 
	updating ebp to ensure correct return value.

3.4
Offset for File Read
	- Not fully utilizing the offset in the file read - issue was in expected
	copy length for file. Also update for using the fdt entries for each file.

Setup Directory Read
	- Invalid implementation of ls. Updated for system call ls and utilizing fdt
	entries for directory.

Index for System Calls
	- Updated the correct number for sys calls - first system call at 1 not at 0.

Needed to check Vidmap
	- Incorrect memory address saved into *screen start - needed to update to ensure
	that outside of kernel space but within user space.

3.5
Fast Pingpong/Fish
	- Speed of pingpong/fish would change when a file other than pingpong/fish
	would be executed. Needed to make sure that the scheduler was aware of the
	current fdt for each process and make sure to read the flags properly.

Page Fault when running simultaneous programs
	- Not updating user page holding current user program to ensure that 
	terminal is running the current user program. 
	- Also needed to update the current user stack for each program

Updating Terminals when Switching
	- Unaccounting for the current page for each terminal when switching between
	terminals to correctly store video memory for each terminal
